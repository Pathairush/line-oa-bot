# Line OA Webhook

- This project has been created to demonstrate how to collect line webhook events and store it in AWS S3.
- Please be noted that the project needs the `/vendor` folder locally for chalice deploy. it uses `pandas==1.2.0` and `numpy==1.19.5` for deploying the apps.
- You have to create those packages from linux instance and then `unzip` the wheel file in the `/vendor` folder. see example [here](https://aws.github.io/chalice/topics/packaging.html)
